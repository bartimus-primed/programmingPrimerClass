# programmingPrimerClass
### This course has a powerpoint slide show to go with it.


# Class goals
### How to break down a problem.
### How to manage dependencies.
### How to interface with APIs.
### How to structure a project.
### Writing clean and concise code, while still being easily extensible.


### DISCLAIMER: 
#### I am completely self taught when it comes to programming, some of my definitions and wording might be overly simplified, especially if your background is computer science. I attempt to explain things in a way that hopefully anyone with a small computer background would understand. It is meant for beginners, though I hope other levels may learn something.

# The why
I believe a lot of computer stuff is unnecessarily complicated, I understand why complicated things exist on a technical level, but I believe it causes unneeded barriers when starting to learn. This course was created for my coworkers who are primarily in the cybersecurity field. The final project could had been a website or something like that, but I feel it doesn't allow people to truly understand whats going on under the hood (no pun intended). That is why the capstone uses a Car as the example (see the capstone folder), since people have different levels of experience.

Like many other intros I know I could had used a more "useful" capstone, but I feel like that could take too much time explaining request headers, useragents, cookies, sessions, etc. I hopefully chose a subject that everyone has some knowledge regarding. I apologize in advance, as I understand that some car experts are going to be real peeved that this isn't a 1 for 1 replica, and that I might have got some systems wrong. My intent was to keep functionality, while keeping it simple, all the while not making something too simple.

I am still adding to the project as it is a work in progress, this includes eventually having 100% commented code, also adding in some test suite. Finally, I built it in a way that if I ever do a Machine Learning course, with some small code additions you could easily teach the virtual car how to drive.

I hope you enjoy!
