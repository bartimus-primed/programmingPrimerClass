## Most of the programming in this capstone, goes hand in hand with the powerpoint.
I attempt to bring in a few new ideas (enums and ownership) so a quick overview:

Enums are just a way to keep track of "default options" in a program. 
They give the ability to take string like data and assign a more friendly programming value to them.
This can be seen in the drivetrain.turn module in the code.
