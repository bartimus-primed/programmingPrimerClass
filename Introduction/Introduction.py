# We Will set our project up, in a similar way to this layout.

# Test Cases (A little talk about TDD, Test Driven Development -> Used often in DevOps)

    # The car starts at point A and gets to Point B
    # The car does not exceed the limit
    # The car stops when the brake is pressed
    # The car moves when the accelerator is pressed
